Analog IO and Timer Exercise/Analog to Digital Conversion

In this code, a simple PWM output signal is produced on the Atmel 328P microcontroller
using ANSI C. Then, the signal is demodulated back to a true analog signal using a RC low-pass filter.
The LPF consists of 10kOhm resistor in series with a 1uF capacitor. After this demodulation, the signal will 
be an analog input of the controller.
